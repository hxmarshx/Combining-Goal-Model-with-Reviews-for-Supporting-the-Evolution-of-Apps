 I ll stick by my one star review. The most annoying app I have that I have to use. Refresh would not get me out of a loop, I knew it was lagging, and then, poof, missed the last 4 minutes of the game. At least the score didn t change. Plus, as usual, Commercials ALWAYS play, and then at some point it skips ahead, missing some of the game. It s like the game buffer doesn t work as good as the commercial buffer. The problem is getting worse. Commercials that only NFL mobile users see play over and over and over and over. Then, some of the game is skipped. Happening  every game, very frequent, annoying commercial breaks. How about more game, less commercial. At least show the game

The windows phone app performed better than on an Android phone. Still locks up and too many other stories play or show first before the highlighted story. Too busy.

 Uninstalled. This USED to be a great app but all of the "updates" have turned it into a useless pile of garbage. Notifications are annoying even when they are turned off. You select a favorite team yet it is never saved. Maybe if they bring back the good app I will install again, but right now it s not worth it, and I m even a Verizon customer.

 When the app works, it s nice to have. However, it seems to hardly ever work. Everything takes forever to load and live feeds buffer constantly, despite my 60+ Mbps internet speed. The app usually gives me my local game for free with Verizon but this last week it would only let me watch the L.A. game and not the Broncos. I would use this app every week to watch the Broncos if it actually worked, but that rarely happens.

 While it provides the needed information, they have been slow in development of better features. It till then a long time to be able to select a way that it doesn t spoil scores for games you want to watch later. And their Google cast ability is poor and copy when it works at all. It feels like they don t see the need to improve the app, since there is no one they compete with.

 This app has been nothing but a pain in the ass. It is a great idea and I would love it if it ever worked. Unfortunately, I have never been a able to watch a full game without the app closing on me or telling me I haven to pay $100 to watch. I have been a Verizon member since I ve owned a phone, and this app should work with my plan. I hope this app works for anyone that actually paid $100 because it has been a waste of my time to try to make it work, and it s supposed to be free for me.

 Verizon used to have it where you could watch any game. Then only local games now there is no rhyme or reason. I live in Central PA and the only game I can watch is taking place in LA. Steelers and eagles games should be allowed but of course I d have to pay 100 bucks to be able to watch it. Hmm way to improve like the unlimited plans.

 The NFL is allowing these rich spoiled players to disrespect our country, and protest against it, yet still enjoying the freedoms our country provides.  They either need to step up or pursue a career with a team in a country that is more to their liking. Additionally, be a professional ball player means that their behavior should be beyond reproach, and since it is a job they need to obey their employers. If the employers chooses to protest our country that employer needs to be removed from the NFL. I m boycotting football, and there are a lot others like me

 Update- 8/17 Still needs work. Ad problem fixed by removing ads all together. Still freezing. Still needs work. But it s better  Just hard to manage, really. If the live stream isn t frozen and buffering then its Alvin and the chipmunks calling the game. Screen resolution changes constantly. When the stream works, I have to listen to the same adds 2+ times per break. Not to mention the location services problems. News is late. Scores are late. Better than nothing, but with the budget the NFL has, this is a joke.

 I like it for the most part. But why are there 15 seconds ads in front of 16 second videos? I m watching ads that are almost as long as the video I am trying to watch. Too many ads just to watch highlights. Before watching the longer interview or talks sure that makes sense. But not for highlights. But overall good app.

 The app build looked good, but I have one huge problem. I have to watch a commercial before every single highlight. Every. Single. Highlight. I understand the idea that a good free app has to make money somehow, but it s so overdone it makes me sick. I would have rather bought the app for $5 and just been able to watch the highlights as I please. Instead, I m deleting it.

 This app could be really great, but unfortunately it s just another ploy for the NFL to make money by blasting you in the butthole.  Why can t I watch my favorite teams while I m not in my home city and am away on business?  Because that would be nice, and because it d be nice, they won t do it. This app is a resounding middle finger to the consumer.

Despite having already purchased a subscription. Customer service is also terrible.  They have no telephone number, only an email to which they don t respond. I ve now emailed them three times asking for assistance with no reply. Garbage app, garbage customer service don t risk buying this to see a game because you won t.

 The app is getting much better; still a lot of hiccups with Game Pass at the start of each year that could have been fixed with basic human validation (content not available, wrong broadcast, etc.).  The fact that audio always seems to be at the bottom of the priority/quality list, but it has now been lumped into the video package for a hefty fee which I have to pay regardless of whether I watch the video or not, is very frustrating.  Would love to see more dev attention paid to the audio broadcasts, or to have it split back into its own package.

 I don t get hardly any of my favorite teams games on this app unless I pay $99. I wish I had that to use. I used to at least get the end zone plays when a team had a chance to score but It s not available any more either. I love watching The New England Patriots. It shouldn t be so hgard to get to see a game.

 Great app. It sucks that you can only watch live games if you are a Verizion customer. Game pass is advertised as if it doesn t matter who your provider is, you can watch live games if you subscribe. I was highly disappointed I paid all that money to watch playbacks I can watch for free on YouTube. Also while watching the games in gamepass, if you have to leave the app

 This app is worse at doing its job than Walt Anderson with a blindfold. It is impossible to disable notifications in this app, notably including the final score of games. If I m taping the game to watch it later, I shouldn t have to hide from my phone to avoid the final score. The button to turn off notifications 100% does not work. I love football, but you guys should feel bad about how awful this app is.

 It gets worse each year!  Now games over 175 miles away are blacked out?  And this is after merging the next-day video and live audio packages, eliminating an affordable option to follow ones team.  Removing the prohibition on rooted devices helps, but Verizon is not the only carrier.  The subscriptions should be available for purchase by any and all football fans.  I d like to at least listen to the audio feed during a game. Quickly approaching pathetic.

 (Update) this season there is a huge delayed when playing a video or a live feed. The scores and downs are also delayed by a significant amount of time. It seems like the audio and video is not in sync  I used it for the last 2 seasons. The only thing I don t like is how buggy the app is. You have to restart the app many times during games causing the user to miss out on the game.

 I purchased the subscription through Google Play, and could only watch the games on my phone, rather than on other devices, even when I logged in with the correct NFL account. Contacted support, took them 2 days to get back to me, told me I would get a refund, never came, had to repurchase for another $99 on my actual yahoo account, never got compensated or heard again from NFL digital support.  They care very little about compensating customers or taking care of them. Greedy and careless to say the least.

 This is a complete ripoff, if you don t want to renew they put you on auto renew and you can t cancel it. They charge you 100 bucks and you have no phone contact to speak with anyone. Just a bogus nfl digital message site that won t help you refund the money.i have already contacted a lawyer. They messed with the wrong guy.

 Excellent source of accurate and up to date NFL news. If I see a story elsewhere, I always come straight here to confirm or debunk it. It s very easy to find scores, stats, and news about the team you want to read about.

I work lots of Sundays and would like to put the game going while I work but hard to do from a small screen. The app works as stated just sucks that the NFL has to control how fans want to enjoy the great game of football.

 This app is garbage, it does nothing that other apps don t already do better than this pile.   This app only gives current game player stats, no player bios or player pages. Clicking on a team doesn t bring you to a team specific page, it does nothing.   Want to see your team s roster?... You have to go to the league standings page in order to click your team, then navigate to the roster.   MLB and NHL both have far superior sports apps, as does NCAA, so why can t the NFL make a decent app?

 Ever since Sunday this app has struggled to load videos. Prior to kickoff weekend l noticed adds before videos freezing constantly. Another concern is the slow upload of games, it is easily 3-5 mins off real-time and l find myself swapping to the drive summary to see four plays ahead of the broadcast. Also why can t l cast this onto a tv, all this frustrates me into wanting to go elsewhere to watch the game or just listen to a local radio coverage of it.

 The pc website is a bit easier to navigate,  and has more to offer , but still a staple for the die hard fans. That being said I get all breaking news faster on my other few football news apps. And you can t change video quality. But quality app overall.

 I enjoy this app. Real time notifications and offers a lot of information. The only downfall that I ve found is if you re a Verizon customer and get the games live (which is awesome BTW), the streaming is roughly 3 to 5 minutes behind in time. So I m receiving an app notification of a score before I m seeing it. Which is a little frustrating. But all in all a good app to have.

 After some recent updates App is working much better. Was able to login and stream the game I wanted to watch with ease. After much frustration not being able to stream a game neither through Xfinity app, nor FoxSports Go, it was NLF mobile from verizon to the rescue.  Now if this could change from "NFL Mobile" to "NFL/NCCAF Mobile" and I could watch my out-of-market college teams, then it would get 5-stars.

They are refusing to refund my $99.99 since it has been over a week since I had it.  So they pull you in by making the Pre-Season Games LIVE, but then, now that they have your money, they swap to ZERO LIVE regular season games.

 Update: Persistent blocking of ability to Chromecast full live games is the elephant in the room. Pathetic. A beautiful app visually that just doesn t do what it should in terms of providing quick access to information. Score updates lag far behind real-time. Individual game pages default to a "showcase" type of overview instead of box score and stat view. Why bury such info via so much nesting without giving users the ability to change the defaults? Why are the standings so clumsy to access? Is anyone actually interested in what users want?

 They ve removed the closed captioning, aka subtitles, from the live stream of games.  Odd choice since the NFL has had many hearing-impaired players in the league s history.   Now I cannot enjoy the games when I m in a loud place. I can watch the plays but with so much talking and chitchatting in-between plays the lack of CC really takes away from the usefulness of the app.

 Ever since it stopped hogging data (ever since Verizon said that this app wouldn t count against monthly data caps) it s gone downhill.  It s good for scores if you re not watching the game, because you ll be 1.5 to 4 minutes behind the game clock, and 3-6 minutes behind the TV broadcast.  It s NOT THE USERS.

 Lag time behind the game play, but might not be a able to fix that. It only is an issue when you hear neighbors celebrating before you ve seen the play. not sure what happened, but data costs now. Also, if you have phone vertical and can see the game stats, it will spoil everything as the score updates 2-5 minutes before the video. Horrible lag. Totally needs to change before NFL loses more fans.

 (Update) this season there is a huge delayed when playing a video or a live feed. The scores and downs are also delayed by a significant amount of time. It seems like the audio and video is not in sync  I used it for the last 2 seasons. The only thing I don t like is how buggy the app is. You have to restart the app many times during games causing the user to miss out on the game.

 Issues, Issues, Issues. Works when it chooses. As a consistent user of this app last season, I was hoping to rely on it heavily to keep up with football action this year. Well, as of week two, that doesn t seem to be the case. Last week, every game I watched was consistently about 3 minutes behind and commercial breaks would run way too long. This week, video doesn t even work( atleast the noon games), and the drive charts and scores are having issues updating. Everytime I want to update a drive chart, I have to back out of the app, close it down, and go back in. Still have a ways to go folks.

 Consistently has problems. When you can watch a game it s great, but it really starts to suck when it gets into these modes where it just loads and loads and loads for live games and then suddenly decides to work the next day for games you don t care about. For example today I m just stuck on "let us check your plan. " I have the Verizon unlimited plan, but I think it would sit and work on checking the plan all day if I let it. Oh well I guess, at least it can tell you what happened after the game is over. That s exciting isn t it?

 [Edit 9-17-17] Been using this app for 3 years now to keep me updated with the NFL, both during the season and in the off season. Hyperlinking is still broken, EH s Power Rankings loses something without them, please fix. Love all the articles with author/column info, videos are great too. The games section is a great place to get stats and live scores. Adding an ability to follow articles/videos by certain analysts would be fantastic addition.

 The red zone stream is at least 5 minutes behind constantly. I can get highlights on Twitter faster. I might as well cancel my subscription and save money.

 Just terrible. Always behind the play, by about 20 minutes. It s currently 27 - 13 NE vs NO and is showing as 20-10! That s two scoring plays behind! Why bother. I d rather use BBC Sport and I m not even sure if they have an NFL section. How much of the taxpayers money do you take. Couldn t hire someone who can actually code no?

 It took 20 minutes for me to actually get RedZone purchased (app was glitchy and could only do it over 4G). Then I learned it doesn t cast, so that was cool. Don t sign up for Redzone if you want to cast from a smartphone. I guess there s a reason for that? Immediately cancelled. Hope some of my $2 goes to paying for player healthcare after retirement (It won t).

Info on all the games, previews, and live streams make this really useful. The only complaint I have is the stream lags often. Hopefully that will be fixed, asides from that really great for a football fan. GO PACK GO

 Takes too long and sometimes never finishes figuring out its head to start playing the game.  If i have this app open and try to access another app, NFL app screen pops up on every click on the other app, like NFL app is still on top and it was clicked upon.   It doesn t allow casting to another device. So if my ph is charging, i have to sit accordingly to watch the game on the phone and can t cast to my T.V. Also, at home we all have verizon and this app by default,  so why can t I cast to TV and have everyone watch on it instead of on their own little screens and not to mention while bogging down the Wi-Fi bandwith?!

 Takes too long and sometimes never finishes figuring out its head to start playing the game.

 App is usually okay, but does not have the "Watch Live" Feature working 100%. It only works for about 4 games a week and I can t get the rest. It also has not been working at all this past week. Whenever I click "Watch Live" the loading wheel just spins for a second and never actually starts the video.

 Obviously there is an issue with app since every other comment since the last two updates are having the same issue as I am. Unable to do anything on the app. One of the reasons I chose Verizon was because of access to this app. Please fix and keep fix and I would be happy to update my rating.

 This app is great. However for some reason the live stream has quit working. Worked for preseason and week one. Now it wants to check my plan and thanks me for my patience. Continues with the "loading" until I lose my patience 20/30 mins. later. When I try one my wife s phone. It logs right into live stream, no questions asked. I would just watch on my wife s phone and it wouldn t be a problem. However has any one tried hanging their wives phone longer then 5sec? It dangerous!!! Would have better luck playing Russian roulette by myself....

 Worked great for watching preseason this year (2017) and the first week, but week 2, neither my friend nor I could get the live games to play. On WiFi and network. It wouldn t load on his phone, and on mine it had to check my verizon account for permission. I had no problems with it last year, even last week. This week, scores wouldn t update, video wouldn t play. Just downloaded the update, tried watching the Monday night game and I get the same thing.

 Paying for redzone, yet I cannot access it. Subscribe to red zone screen pops up when selecting redzone, and selecting subscribe button brings up error screen that I am already subscribed in an endless loop. Re-installing does no good.

 This app never works on game days and always seems to have issues every week. Live streams are a hassle they either buffer constantly, load without making any progress or just do not work at all. Used to be pretty reliable last season but now has a horrible lag time on games that will work. Like last season, the app crashes regularly and even more than ever. Also, they say it doesn t use data for Verizon users but IT DOES.

 Just upgraded to the Samsung Note 8. Every time I try to stream a game (doesn t matter who is playing mind you) the stream NEVER loads!! Just keep clicking the "play" button hoping for a hail mary.

Very much appreciated! Bottom line - my Samsung Galaxy 8 came preloaded with the NFL Mobile app. I simply uninstalled u0026amp;gt; browsed to the Google Play store and reinstalled.

 I have not been able to watch a primetime and/or in market game as of 9/11/17 (1st game worked but 2nd game did not stream). If I try to stream using mobile data, I keep getting a pop-up that says I do not have access to stream the game per Verizon s service. If I try to stream using Wi-Fi, the app endlessly loads. I would attach images if I could to help visualize the issue.   Also, this issue only happens on my phone (Samsung galaxy s7 edge) and not my wife s phone (iPhone 7)  UPDATE: I think I got my streaming issue to work now. Try the following steps: 1. Uninstall app updates 2. Disable app 3. Enable, download, and install 4. Update app After this I am able to watch NFL network live as expected. Hopefully it continues to work come this Sunday.

For those who are having a hard time streaming games after the recent update: go clear you app data and cache (as recommended in a comment from the devs).  Once I did that, it requested permissions for location and to send and view sms (! -see below).  After that it sent a text to verify my subscription, read a reply, and then I was able to stream games again.  I then went and removed the permission to send/view sms... So far it continues to work.  For the devs: I do not believe it was previously necessary for you to verify subscription status in this manner.  Can I get an explanation or pointer to some documentation that justifies your need for this permission?  Also, will you please verify that the app will continue to stream games if this permission is revoked post verification?  App review: it s a decent app.  Works well enough and is reasonably stable.  Some issues I had with it last year seem to have been corrected.  I do still occasionally have minor trouble streaming games but it s easy enough to correct it.

 I like the app, but it doesn t function well.  Lots of bugs while watching games.  The feed acts up, usually just from accidentally changing the screen orientation by rotating the phone, and I end up closing and reopening the app a bunch of times.

 The app leaves a lot to be desired from a technical standpoint. Videos still lag, IF THEY PLAY AT ALL, on WiFi or cellular. Too much video and video advertising, and not enough simple write-ups (text). Funny that the NFL can t get it s media vids to play correctly, but the commercials play perfectly. That problem is across ALL their platforms/sites.

 It is great when it comes to highlights and news, but you have to have Verizon to watch games and I can t afford Verizon. Over all a disappointing app, but still great for highlights.

There doesn t seem to be any obvious bugs, and the application is visually appealing. If I had to pick one thing wrong with this application, it would be that it is not available for "smart" televisions powered by Android TV - but hopefully this will change in the future...

 A few knuckleheads I can deal with, but when whole teams and the league itself pull this b.s. I m done. I loved football draft to playoffs, now we get ONE side of a political left agenda... I highly doubts they d allow and encourage pro 2nd Ammendment protests now would they. That s besides the fact PUBLIC tax money is and was used to build most stadiums, use up public services like police, traffic, etc. Not to mention ALL public broadcasts are owned by the people and their cables and SATs are on public land and airways. So it would appear they re in violation of equal time for opposing political views. I have no problem with people exercising their rights nut not when it s using public funds without equal presentation of views. Do it on their own time.

 App worked fine throughout the preseason and now it doesn t play the one game I desperately wanted to watch being that Im from Houston so I missed that game, Thanks for a bad experience btw. So I figured it might be because i needed to sign in and it allowed me to do that but it still did allow me to watch the game, So then, I tried to sign on to my provider and it wouldn t recognize me at all and even said that I couldn t use symbols in my username which I DO NOT have soI can t sign in to my provider. Wrote to the feedback and I basically nothing but an automated msg telling me to try things I already tried. Finally got feed up and decided to delete the app and now about to reinstall it to see if that helped. Either fix this app or its going to the same place as clip phones did , to the curb, because I don t need a broken app taking up space on my phone.

 App works great, however the free games they play are always for the same teams: Patriots, Steelers, Packers (always with the East coast favoritism). They re always games that are in-market and already free on TV. It would be nice to see a West coast game for once or a team I like instead of the teams I despise.

 Since the latest update this app has performed well not too many hiccups and I am glad to see it working well.  Love the amount of games I can stream via the app vs television better games because less commercials and if there is a commercial it is short and then there is a wait until the game is back on

 I ve been a Raiders fan since I could say the word "football". Frankly, the NFL has fumbled the football with this kneeling bullzhit during the Star-Spangled Banner.  The song itself includes the lines, "By the millions unchain d who our birthright have gained. We will keep her bright blazon forever unstained!" The song itself embodies the essence of these kneeling protests. To protest the very thing you espouse is...well its ridiculous.   Essentially the NFL has taken over as "America s past-time". With that comes great responsibility; not to be a political backdrop of irresponsible protest, but to be a reflection of the American spirit.  I give this ap 1 star because it doesn t operate properly. I give the NFL 1 star in honor of the Dallas Cowboys, not because I hate the franchise (i do ;) ), but because the Dallas Cowboys stood up when the NFL would not.

 Android version of the app adds a massive delay (like 3+ minutes of play time) relative to live coverage. Makes it so it s impossible to monitor fantasy scores without receiving spoilers.  EDIT: Have already attempted re-installing and have reported feedback within the app. This would very much seem to be an intentionally added delay for Android devices.

 I spent a lot of time in Wisconsin since I was a small child.  l ve lived about 10 miles from the boarder of Illinois.  My parents went all over that state starting at Three Lakes Wis.  That was when I saw my first Native American, up close and personaI.  Then I spent my teenage years at Wilmot skiing.  But now I spend my time watching  the Greenbay Packer.  I have bought a lot of jerseys, tee shirts ang pajama pants... and even the dolls.  I know it soundes crazy, but it s helps me to imagine what it would be like to be in that stadium.  I pray that when it s time for me to go to a nursing home, I want it to be in Wisconsin!!!   ...I have dementia...

 This app is useless for games unless you like ads. It doesn t work most of the time for live games. Doesn t work if you are using wifi. Burn your data so you pay either way. NFL appears more greedy and irrelevant by the day. Wish it wasn t stuck on my phone. Used to love the NFL. I am a diehard fan of one team but will no longer go out of my way to watch games. I m here to watch football, not play with an app that doesn t like me nor the idiotic politics they want to shove down my throat. You re losing a lot of us diehards, NFL Network. I don t care to see your meaningless canned response either. Just fix your moronic tools, let us watch football and keep it to football. Sick of the politics.

 Live streams constantly have issues even showing up. Expect to miss the first half of the first quarter every game. Occasionally they just go black and you can t fix them.  Even when they do work they  will still be 5 minutes behind.   Edit: since the developer or a bot replied. The app is always up to date, and I tried the internal feedback and got a canned response in my email that was utterly useless.  Edit2: Trying to connect now and the app will not connect to the network.  Restarted my phone, now the app won t even show "watch live as an option."  Connection to all other facets of the internet work fine.  Edit3: Now watch live appears but "video is currently unavailable." 20 minutes into the game.

 I had the "no game stream" problem for about 2 weeks. I did an uninstall/re-installation  of the app and it works as it did for me before the problem. The one existing issue I have is the significant lag in game streaming. At its worst it has been 3-5 minutes behind actual game play. Not a major offense (if your options are limited), but yahoo streamed an nfl game on its mobile app and their was no lag that I could see.  Not trying to be nitpicky, but right is right.

 Issues, Issues, Issues. Works when it chooses. As a consistent user of this app last season, I was hoping to rely on it heavily to keep up with football action this year. Well, as of week two, that doesn t seem to be the case. Last week, every game I watched was consistently about 3 minutes behind and commercial breaks would run way too long. This week, video doesn t even work( atleast the noon games), and the drive charts and scores are having issues updating. Everytime I want to update a drive chart, I have to back out of the app, close it down, and go back in. Still have a ways to go folks.  Update: Now a week later the app won t let me watch anything because it has to "check my plan"? I ve been a Verizon customer for 7 years and you ve never had an issue with my plan before.

 The NFL keeps going downhill. Took a knee on paying them this year.  2016: There were issues with this app at the beginning of last season, and those issues seem to have returned. I have Verizon, paid $99 for all season access, and this week (Thursday night, week 7) we re back to not being able to stream the live video or the radio broadcast. This is very frustrating.

 I love the fact that all the stats and info are so readily available. I also like being able to watch some games on the app. My biggest complaint is that the "live footage" is not actually live. The app gives me notifications for big plays before it happens on my  live stream.  If the streaming was actually live it would be a 5/5.

 Just upgraded to the Samsung Note 8. Every time I try to stream a game (doesn t matter who is playing mind you) the stream NEVER loads!! Just keep clicking the "play" button hoping for a hail mary. Very frustrating! Never had this issue on my Samsung Note Edge. HELP???!!!!  UPDATE: First off, hats off to the developers and support staff. Less than an hour after submitting I had a response. Very much appreciated! Bottom line - my Samsung Galaxy 8 came preloaded with the NFL Mobile app. I simply uninstalled u0026amp;gt; browsed to the Google Play store and reinstalled. Works like a charm. Great app - keep up the good work.

 I have not been able to watch a primetime and/or in market game as of 9/11/17 (1st game worked but 2nd game did not stream). If I try to stream using mobile data, I keep getting a pop-up that says I do not have access to stream the game per Verizon s service. If I try to stream using Wi-Fi, the app endlessly loads. I would attach images if I could to help visualize the issue.   Also, this issue only happens on my phone (Samsung galaxy s7 edge) and not my wife s phone (iPhone 7)  UPDATE: I think I got my streaming issue to work now. Try the following steps: 1. Uninstall app updates 2. Disable app 3. Enable, download, and install 4. Update app After this I am able to watch NFL network live as expected. Hopefully it continues to work come this Sunday.

 I am a United States Navy Mom and will not be disrespected by the NFL and it s players, coaches and owners. I am uninstalling your app along with boycotting games until you all get your s@#t together. Please educate yourselves on the meaning of the flag and what it represents. Lesson 1: The color red is the blood of blacks, Asians, whites etc who fought and died or who fought and were  injured fighting for the freedom of this great country. You have multiracial players coming together as a team to win a game. That flag represents a multiracial armed force to protect this country of ours. Think of the hypocrisy of that.

I will never support a company that hates the United States of America. The NFL needs the U.S. But the U.S. doesn t need the NFL. I hope your ratings plummet this year and sponsors pull out. Those players that disrespect the flag dont deserve to make a penny from a United States sport that provides that salary. I stand for every soldier that died to create the United States before 1776. I stand for every United States soldier from 1776 until now that died for MY flag. HOME OF THE FREE BECAUSE OF THE BRAVE.

 The App is great, I ve used it for 3 yrs and haven t experienced any problems. That being said, after being a fan of the NFL since Joe Nameth brought the Jets to win the Super Bowl in 1969, I have boycotted the NFL this year due to the kneeling while our National Anthem is sung. Will not use App or watch NFL football!

 Good info and usability. Some video load/playback issues, gets stuck on  checking your account  when connected to WiFi. Have to turn off WiFi, close app an relaunch to get it to work but then you are pulling form mobile data. Typically video will play after turning wifi back on so you don t eat up data. Also, the notifications are not easily controlled. Limited options in app to control. Even if you turn off notifications you will still be receiving them. Have to swipe right on a notification to turn off or silence them for a time. Needs improvement.

We re watching you get paid millions to do a job, not hijack it for a soapbox for your factually wrong propaganda and political beliefs. We re sick of all facets of our lives politicized. Sports should be a venue where we dont have to hear about politics for a while. The players are doing just the opposite. The "injustices" these players claim to be protesting are complete fallacies with zero merit. All they seek to do is further the racial divide and Blame "whitey" for everything again, blame everyone but themselves. Just like Hillary, eh?

 This app is about as cumbersome as generic zip-loc bags. You think it works well, until you find out your food is moldy.  Adds run the content basically, so just like with the games you ll be more distracted with the sponsors or guys on one knee than you will actual user-data. It s all pretty lame.  Need the score, ask Suri.

They consume the freedom provided by the sacrifices of others to play a game for a living, but can t be bothered to show any appreciation for not having to fight for their own survival. Disgusting. I m pleasantly surprised that I can now completely uninstall this app on my Galaxy Note 8.  Was a forced app on my Galaxy S7 Edge.

I do not pay for cable so I have to go to the bar or watch it on my phone. I wish they would start making us pay more to use devices such as chromecast to watch on the TV or pay per game.

 Advertises in big letters "watch more NFL" when it s actually listen to more NFL, yeah you get the re-runs of the games but that s not my idea of watching more NFL. They made it sound like the Sunday ticket. When I asked for a refund they gave me the run around and said that I have to contact Google. I tried to follow the NFL site to get my refund through "my account" but when I checked my subscriptions it said I had none. So I paid $99 for nothing and emailing them again didn t help. Stupid app, ridiculous price for a radio service, and awful customer service. NO STARS!! (Monocle falls off face)

If the NFL wants to stop this controversy just stop with the patriotic show.  My brothers in arms died so people could have liberty.   I watch sports to think about other things besides politics, crime, and moral decay.   America is not perfect but we move forward.   I really think those that take a knee should do a ride along and see what police have to put up with and how fast they need to react.  Next i think police should live as a black for a week to feel what it feels like.  Don t protest without a solution or you re just a part of the problem. Protest on your own time and dime!

 Half ass coverage of games, the watch live feature is technically a recap. You don t get to have a three minute lag these days and call it live. As will sometimes happen with a monopoly they do a poor job and don t care much how you feel about it. This app is handy for seeing the schedule and what network to watch it on. Then again, Google could do that, and you probably wouldn t even have to exit and reopen the app every 3 minutes. What a waste.

 The app works great but I m no longer watching. While I recognize their 1st amendment rights I certainly don t agree with a bunch of whiney millionaires who blame everyone else for the state of their communities while they do nothing to improve them. This has become a liberal fueled hate Trump campaign and I will have no part of it. Again, there is no place in sports for this. If they really wanted to make a difference perhaps they should have studied law in college instead of football. The angry mob of mindless sheep can do whatever they want. I am a free thinker. The NFL has lost my business until this nonsense stops. I have many friends that feel the same way. Hope the sponsors are paying attention.

You are spitting on my fathers grave which is in Arlington National Cemetery and came home under one. We grew up without him and I will NEVER stand by and watch this kind of behaviour. Our Mother was handed a folded flag and went on to raise us 4 small children alone! If they feel this country is so bad..then move..you are not trees. Find another country that will let you get the millions you re making! Get the hell out!   This will NOT let me uninstall!  Very Frustrating! PLEASE tell me how to uninstall.

 Update:  The app is now crashing every few minutes. So now, not only do I have to sign off my wireless, start the video using LTE, then turn wireless back on, I now get the pleasure of random crashes. I m to the point where I would rather stream from a shady third party site with malware and spyware; at least their streams are stable.

 I like the service and being able to watch the games. I hate that you can t rewind and fast forward easily. Take a page from Hulu or Amazon please. Also, when I have to pause the game and do something on my phone the game I m watching starts over, with no easy way to fast forward to my place, and no memory of about where I was I end up having to watch a minute or 2 of what I just watched. The NFL had tons of money, I definitely expect better

 Due to the politics in the NFL, I am uninstalling this app. Yes, you do have the right to protest.  I even understand why you are using the football stadium as the platform. However,  I don t watch football for the politics.  In fact,  I watch it to get away from politics, if just for a moment.  How about protesting at the White House, do a PSA, protest at a police station, have a walk down the public syreet. Go to the root of the problem and make your voice heard. The answer is not taking a knee during the National Anthem.  Surely, you have noticed your players are not getting the support they had hoped for.  #bebetterdobetter

 The app never loads with the score. Do not watch the game vertically, you will have the video ruined Everytime. It doesn t load every game it says you re allowed to watch, you will be blacked out. It s easier to go to YouTube and watch pirated copies.

 No multi-tasking allowed. Data does not always get refunded for free Verizon usage. Audio is consistently slightly off which isn t a big deal until commentators are on screen. Game is delayed so scores show up faster than the video feed. Other than that it is great and I use it every Sunday.

 I use to love this app and it was one of the reasons I stayed on Verizon. Now when I try to watch a live game, it won t let me use WiFi and it eats my data. I used up all my data for the month in less than a half of one game. I may look for a different provider now since Verizon is definitely not the cheapest and now doesn t have anything that makes me wasn t to stay. The only reason I didn t give it 1 star was because I can still use it for game updates, but I can find those elsewhere.

 I want football, not irresponsible politics. The NFL s stance with BLM, which is a terrorist organization targeting our law enforcement, is unconscionable. Keep your bullcrap app and all your broadcasts.  Not watching, ***not patronizing your sponsors***.

 I also am a Verizon Wireless customer have been for several years and I pay the extra fee for this app used to love it.  Recently it s constantly asking for up dates in was ok with it until this recent one.  Now all it does is freezes up buffers and I can t watch what I pay for.  Also having the same problem as a few of the others with the scores not updating. Very disappointing

 Congratulations NFL, you have officially turned the league into a political circus, truly topping the cake with responding to the Trump in an even more childish way.  This app only has articles that reinforce this nonsense.  I was such a fool to so closely follow the NFL and spent thousands on the dang sport.... I m out!

Oh by the way, the NFL did not allow the Dallas Cowboys to pay respect to the officer that was killed last year, l guess they did not want to get political then. Wow , now teams are stating that they "Will stand for unity!", what a joke, l am sure they were told to stand due to the backlash.

 Id remove this app if I could. I want no part of an organization that disrespects not only our anthem, but the people who fought and died protecting the freedoms it stands for.  They frown upon someone like Tim Tebow when he kneels in prayer, but embraces those who kneel during our anthem.  Pure political garbage the NFL has turned into.

 Live games are about 2min behind when streaming whereas the app still updates the score in live time without delay.  Makes it hard to watch games appropriately.  In past years there has been a roughly 30 second delay due to streaming which is perfectly acceptable.  But this new switch to a 2+ minute delay is ridiculous!

 The reason is because they allow NFL players take a knee and disgracefully disrespect our nation every game they play. They can protest before and After the game. Reason being is that once they put on the uniform they clock in to work and not to protest.  Everyone has to put everything aside once they clock in to work and follow their jobs rules  and once they clock out they can do what they want.  How can they do this with a straight face,  people who get paid millions and we  who earn way less don t do  such acts.

 My Gamepass subscription auto-renewed. I tried to immediayely get a refund from Google Play and they wouldn t issue a refund. I have Verizon, and have plenty enough free services with them. So, I decided I did like the condensed games and kept Gamepass just for that. I cannot access Gamepass though with my login I ve used for my past 3 consecutive Gamepass subscriptions. I contacted NFL Digital Care to try and restore access over 30 days ago. Then contacted them again after 6 days with no response. At the 10 day mark, they replied with a cut/paste on how to get a refund. I replied back, and I detailed how I just need access to the service I paid for. 30 days since my initial contact. No further responses from NFL Digital Care. Worst service I ve ever  encountered. Never though the NFL would be such crooks!

 For an app by made by a huge corporation, you would think it would work better then it does. How much money is floating around the NFL? And their app can t even work right? Damn shame.

 Hate it! Subscribed to GamePass back before pre-season. Now everything I try to use GamePass on (Phone, Ps4, Roku) says I m signed in but keeps telling me to subscribe to GamePass. NFL support is garbage as well they don t respond back, I ve been waiting 4 days for a response. I will never pay for another NFL product, you would think being a multi billion $ organization they would have a good network team and fully functioning app.

 Had to do a lot to get live games to work again. App crashes often while watching games. Having already read the recommendation to update the app and set permissions, I followed those directions and got the games to play; however, the app keeps crashing and to watch half of one game, I had to clear the cache and allow permissions 4 times. For only Half of a game. Last year, I watched multiple games each Sunday all season and never had a problem. Not sure why the change, but it sure is annoying. Also, major spiller when the scores update before the video feed shows a change. Better than not getting to see any of the games, though!

 The app does almost everything I would want it to do, except automatically going to the most recent game of the team I have selected as my favorite. (It currently starts you off at the next upcoming game, which you obviously can t watch, since it hasn t happened yet.)  The reason I didn t rate it 5 stars is that I have a consistent issue with latency. I press a button, and it takes so long to register that I think that it wasn t detected. Also, it would be nice if the app remembered where you left off, when you stop watching a game, and then come back to it.

 I have been trying to get a refund for game pass since 8/20/17. I bought it for my bf and he didn t need it. I was within trial time. Customer service takes at least a week to respond and 2 times I have been told  I was refunded, only to wait 3 days and check my card to see that I wasnt. SO FRUSTRATING. Buy your guy/girl a Google gift card if your thinking about something like this, not the app. There is no going back!

 When it works, it s an alright app. It usually won t load games properly to stream and I have to uninstall/reinstall before it will play a game. But worst of all, I have a Moto Z Force, and the fact that the NFL blocks me from being able to watch games through the projector mod is a really dumb move. But what should I expect from the No Fun League, right? Update: So apparently, you can use the projector to watch the Thursday Night Football games that are streaming through Amazon Prime. But at the same time, the same game, you can t use the projector for the game playing through this app. That is the epitome of stupid. Can I lower this to 0 stars?

 Very slow, locks up, limited meaningful statistics.  This app gets worse every year.  I ve read the NFL responses saying to make sure you have the latest app and to clear the cache. B.S. I ve done that and it is still slow to update scores, if it does it at all.

 I am a United States Navy Mom and will not be disrespected by the NFL and it s players, coaches and owners. I am unable to uninstall your app that doesn t work anyway, so I am boycotting games until you all get your s@#t together. (It will no longer let me live stream games.) Please educate yourselves on the meaning of the flag and what it represents. Lesson 1: The color red is the blood of blacks, Asians, whites etc who fought and died or who fought and were  injured fighting for the freedom of this great country. You have multiracial players coming together as a team to win a game. That flag represents a multiracial armed force to protect this country of ours. Think of the hypocrisy of that. SHAME ON YOU!!!!

Please educate yourselves on the meaning of the flag and what it represents.

Lesson 1: The color red is the blood of blacks, Asians, whites etc who fought and died or who fought and were  injured fighting for the freedom of this great country.
1.4
You have multiracial players coming together as a team to win a game.
1.2
That flag represents a multiracial armed force to protect this country of ours.

Think of the hypocrisy of that.

 I love the app even though it s a data hog. My main complaint is that the game  feeds are far from live - routinely lagging the live action by at least a full possession. Stop claiming it s live! On a related note, everyone knows every score has to be reviewed. Therefore you should hold up on posting scores until the play is reviewed,  so you don t have to correct it. That happens way too often.

 Game Pass has too many problems to be worth more than $0.99/year. Paused the Packer/Cowboy game (today s archived game) after watching about 30 minutes of it, while I stepped away from my phone. Now the game will NOT load even after clearing cache/data and restarting app. Tried watching ANY other game and had NO problems with them playing. Every week I have problems with this piece of trash app. Wish they would just refund me the rest of the season, but customer support is basically non-existant.

 NFL is absolutely horrible! I ll stand for the Flag of the United States of America and kneel for the Cross. I boycott the NFL n had before the season even started because of the whole Zeke thing n how the NFL thinks they re above the law and can make their own decisions. NFL wont be able to filully pull back from this one n have lost lots of fans that will never return. Thanks for ruining the only sport i loved.

 Live access via Verizon suddenly not working. Receiving a connectivity error, despite strong WiFi and 4G connections. Huge disappointment.  Update: clearing app data and cache did allow me to connect to the stream. To do this, go into Settings, then Apps, then choose the NFL Mobile app. Under Storage, you ll find options to delete App Data and Cache.  This really shouldn t be necessary, and the delay and frequent buffering earn the otherwise good app 3 stars.

 I m a Verizon customer. The few perks you get for being a Verizon customer do not work. Can t get NFL redzone to work. The app sometimes freezes. The app game feed is much later then the actual game on your cable provider. The app is a mess but if your an NFL fan. Your stuck using this.

 The only reason people use this app is to stream nfl games through Verizon. They have worked so hard to keep their app from getting hacked that it has taken away from user experience.  If I am initially on Wi-Fi, I have to disconnect from my Wi-Fi before it realizes that I can stream nfl games. It often lags and disconnects.

 Games are about 5 min behind. I ve deleted then redownloaded the app and still behind. Most people I talk to have live games that are consistent with the scoreboard. I have tried on WiFi and in a 4G network. Any thought on how to fix this?

 6 updates in the past month, and they STILL can t get this app working so many of us can actually watch games. App worked fine previous years, and even week 1 on this season. Since then, I ve only been able to watch a couple games last Saturday. Otherwise, like others, I m told I have no network. Funny, looks like I have full WiFi bars and 3-4 bars of 4G, to me. Absolutely unacceptable. Get someone who can properly fix the problem. I ll update this if/when they get someone competent to fix this unusable mess of an app. A month of half a dozen worthless updates is ridiculous.

 Is app is horrible. It used to be worth your time having on your phone, but not anymore. The "live" footage is atleast 5 minutes behind as well as the play by play, and the overall reliability of the app is bad too. Try to watch a highlight and the ads load great, but your video won t load more than 5 seconds most the time. I ve had multiple chances to use the app on brand new phones, different carriers with great service, or while on reliable WiFi, and I ve had the same issue every time. Do yourself a favor and skip this app, go download Twitter and follow the teams you want updates from for live coverage. Any other source of coverage is better than the NFL s own app.

 Revised from a 1 to a 4.  After following  the troubleshooting tips, the app now works as advertised.  Ideally, I should not have to clear settings, uninstall, reinstall, manually change permissions and reboot just to get it working. Happy to have notifications and live streaming back.

 Scores do not refresh and update themselves often, i have to manually refresh to get updated scores and then sometimes it doesn t do that well. This is the official nfl app and there s no way that a 3rd party app should be better with providing better updates.

 I have no idea how this app has gotten worse in the last year. The actual live feed is 3 minutes behind the real time. So you have to watch games in landscape mode. Otherwise u ll see the score and actual time of the game and know what happens before you watch it. And really still can t cast to Xbox so I can watch it on TV? Why the hell is a casting option even available.

This last time they did message me in the last message saying they can t reactivate my account and if I wish I can PURCHASE another. ??? WYD I just spent $99 two months ago and you want me to buy another gamepass subscription? I sent them credit card statements, and Google play receipt and still they can t activate my account they want me to purchase another?

 I only use the app for GamePass as it s the only way to stream the service. This is the dedicated GamePass app - there are no alternatives for Android. Playing videos the same day they come out is problematic, which kinda defeats the purpose for cable cutters trying to watch sports. The app is free, granted, but GamePass is not ($99/year). Feeling disappointed.  As a side note, nothing to do with the app, but the streaming quality is garbage, even with 75 Mb/s broadband.

 After purchasing the redzone add-on, it has so far been unusable three out of six weeks (weeks 1, 5, 6). Up until week 5, I was unable to watch the "included" games (Thursday, Sunday Monday nights, plus local games). My repeated attempts to contact customer service via email have been responded to with automated bot replies.   I ve been a customer going on four years, and have loved it, but at this point this level of customer care and unwillingness to even address the problem, let alone make any attempt at correction, is simply unacceptable.

 Its an essential app to have in order to follow your team and other teams as well if you re a football fan. Keeps me updated.  In game plays and scoreboard need to update a lot faster.

 It rarely works. I m incredibly disappointed that you cannot cast supposed "live" coverage (NFL regulations) even though the stream is delayed 1 - 2 minutes versus OTA signal.  On Chromecast s website, NFL Mobile app is listed as compatible. I suppose it works if you want to cast game highlights. Yeehaw! In addition, I receive notifications about Thursday and Monday Night games, and the accompanying phrase, "INCLUDED. ON VERIZON  only to find those games won t load/stream. As a "cord-cutter" (Yeah, I guess I get what I pay for), basically, if I can t watch OTA coverage, then I can t watch it on NFL Mobile. And quite honestly, sometimes that doesn t work, either. Perhaps the fine persons at Verizon should research the definition of the word "INCLUDED". I got the impression (with Verizon s assistance) that this was virtually a mobile "Sunday Ticket" INCLUDED. ON VERIZON.  I guess it s just like nearly everything else, "the devil is in the details", Verizon and Chromecast notwithstanding.

 Great app, perfect 4 keeping up on the league. Only issue is the live streaming games. All of the time there s communication u0026amp; connection issues, not 2 mention the volume on the games is fixed (doesn t get any louder) but the commercial volumes are way higher. But when the games sync up u0026amp; stream properly, it s an awesome app u0026amp; I m more than thankful that it s free.

review content:
 Lets see: NFL first. A bunch of racist hypocrites who think our great country owes them even more than it has already given their ungrateful ignorant and self entitled asses. They are weak minded and they  expect us to follow them in their ignorance. But I guess they are just trying to soften up for when the boy scout girls come into the league. They probably will need to get off steroids and all for real by then. Because though nothing like 2 generations ago, men are still stronger and bigger and meaner than women are at this very moment. If that statement offends you, then you offend me, liar. So shut up and let me enjoy my first amendment right. The NFL has not been worth watching since, (and this is a stretch) the 90s at best and it was on its way down then. Personally I whish I d quit watching in the 70s. But it s time to close this chapter in our great country s history books now completely so the liberals can lie and rewrite them to fit the horseshit they are spewing from their ignorant lying lips and dragon tongues with the stench of liberal media salivating on every word and poisoning the brains of the ignorant and weak unwise sheeple at that time. You don t deserve even 1 of my tax dollars. I m not supporting your agenda. The USA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND IF IT JOINS THE WORLD IN A UNIT WE WILL BE NO STRONGER OR. BETTER THAN THE WEAKEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. GLOBALISM IS FOR FOOLS. THE NFL IS FOR WINING racist blacks and LIBERALS WHO ARE TO STUPID TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES. That really goes without saying but for those who can t think for themselves, rasists, of all colors, and levels of ignorance, hold your fist up for your color in hate if you want to and it shall be cut off at the sleeve by the hand of GOD. So nfl and all others who disrespect freedom and those who faught for it I cannot give you more respect than you deserve and u deserve an amount about just under the level of a cockroach or a flea. All of you baby boys who think this world owes you should go to another country and play for their nfl or just go live like the other unfree live but stay out of my life you re wasting it and none of us have enough.

 I loved the app last year. Got to watch almost all of my Steelers and any of the other games I watched worked well. Now I ve been able to watch maybe 3 games in totality. All of the others the app stops playing the game or there is a pause in the feed when there is nothing wrong with the Wi-Fi. I have to constantly delete the cache for the app to get some games to even load. I also got to Chromecast the games to my tv last year. Now it has due to copyright this game can not be cast. I wish they would change that back.

 I used to like football before all this eqaulity talk started.   It s not fair that I should only make a few dollars an  hour while in one hour of a game players and owners make millions.  When all people make the same I will watch it again. Dropping Collin K to the unemployment line was a good start in eqaulity.  Now he can feel what the people he is protesting for feel.

 I don t want to have this app on my cell. I have complained to Verizon about not being able to delete this from my service. I don t support the NFL or the players do to the protests during the National Anthem. They are on the job and therefore are representatives of the association they work for. If they want to protest they can do it on their own time.

Online (non mobile) we can go further back to 2009 but for me, I d like there to be a way to see old Brett Favre, Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana games if it were possible.

 App is not working correctly as usual! Watch one video, which sound sucks, and the whole app shuts down every time!  Extremely limited feeds for select stories with no search.  Provides barely any information for real fans.  Only good part is live stream for Verizon customers WHEN IT ACTUALLY WORKS.

Commercials that only NFL mobile users see play over and over and over and over. Then, some of the game is skipped. Happening  every game, very frequent, annoying commercial breaks. How about more game, less commercial. At least show the game.

 This app works 50% of the time. Right now as of 10/22/2017...the app won t give me the regular standings for the NFC. When you press the button to navigate from AFC to NFC, it just shows the AFC regular season standings only. I m sure it will eventually get fixed. But if it s not that problem there is another problem. There always seems to be something that doesn t work properly. You would figure for NFL s only official app...they would be a little more efficient than they are. This app has been junk for the last 4 years. I m better off at finding scores/standings on gambling websites!

 This app is the absolute worst app to use. It never works. The games scores never update. The different conference s standings never load correctly. The live games are hit or miss on quality. It freezes regularly. It sends way too many notifications when it does work. I d recommend never installing this absolutely horrid app and just using Google to find updates on games or even the ESPN  app. I ll say it again this app sucks and never should have made it to the app store.

The screen resolution was just as good or better than a flat screen TV and better than I could get on my PC laptop. I subscribed to Yahoo TV for $35 a month in order to complete the setup. It s subscription with a television service is required in order to watch a game. Now I can select from all of the NFL games being played and I can switch from game to game. And, it s mobile!

 The Washington Redskins are my team. I live in Portland Oregon whenever you show games they only show the games that you can see on TV anyway. Except Monday and Thursday but, it s my opinion that NFL programming is down because you split up your games between different broadcast companies that require money to show those games. So you save me a little money on Monday and Thursday thank you I want to remain an NFL fan and I would like to be able to mirror my phone to my TV for this service to be forced to watch it on the phone isn t fair

 Good for keeping up on Sundays, but only if you have unlimited data. Video streaming data-usage wayyy too high to use anywhere but on wifi.

 I think the app works decently. They have fixed the chromecast issue. Often, however, the app says that I need to purchase gamepass before watching games and I have already purchased gamepass. To clarify, these are not live games. They are the replays that I receive through my gamepass subscription. Very annoying.

 The app itself is decent. Good layout and easy navigation of content. By default there s too many notifications turned on so it would be nice to ask the user which notifications they would like upon first time opening the app.  The reason for the low score from me is purely from a streaming standpoint. The app has a significant delay (as bad as 10-15 minutes) from live broadcast. This makes it pretty much my very last resort and even then sometimes I just look at gamecast from espn instead. In this day and age, that level of delay is not acceptable for streaming of live sports. The app itself will also have updated scores and stats so by the time you load the stream you already know what will happen.

review content:
 Last year to watch the packers games it worked well for me. This year I ve tried to watch a couple of games and it wasn t showing them even though they were home games, which in the description it explains those would be the games I could watch. I attempted to reach out to customer support by email and I did get some responses quickly. Unfortunately after a couple of emails they just stopped replying and I never got an answer back. I was rather upset and just went and bought a digital tv antenna to watch the rest recent game after wasting time trying to get an answer back and missing most of the game. So I rates 2/5 for it sometimes working for me and not so great customer support.

 Watching live games on this app has become more trouble than it s worth. Freezes and buffers constantly. When the game finally starts to play it s all pixelated and blurry. Always freezes during play and then comes back when the play is over, odd. Other than that I enjoy this app for all NFL news and highlights.

 Unbelievably bad. It is amazing the NFL created a product of such poor quality and does nothing to fix the numerous bugs. For instance, the standings page only shows the AFC, regardless if you select AFC or NFC.   However, that is only minor compared to how the app cannot keep track of the game if you go to another app, but keep the NFL app open. In order to "catch up", you have to close the NFL app and then relaunch it. The NFL should be embarrassed by the lack of quality in this application.

 Honestly I haven t gotten to see the Seahawks play for five weeks now since the NFL wants to split up programming with the networks but sure as ever I can see all the teams out east I could care less about, it would be nice to watch my team play when free tv is not showing it because they feel more people want to watch golf, bull riding etc. How about you set this app up to allow people to select one team they can watch every game for the particular season. I will be disabling this app asap

 Love the app, love the idea it is just so unbelievably slow, I hate how it s constantly giving me scores that were relevant 10+ minutes ago. You can refresh the page but that just slows it more and confuses it while the scores change even more. I really like the app but you really can t use it much.not to mention you can only get some games live on only Verizon. We don t use that so the only games we can see live are the ones on TV. Still comes highly recommended, GO PATRIOTS!!!!!!

 The app crashes far too often. Sometimes it will actually take the plays/scores backward, so it does not synch itself well. I tried to use this on the go when broadband comnection was limited but still better than old school dial-up speeds. If that was the design in mind, then go back to the drawing board on this one guys, because it is a failure.

 Good app, but it doesn t do what you tell it to.  When I look at standings it only shows AFC, when you click on NFC it still shows AFC. I forced the app to stop in the application manager and cleared the cache/data, same problem. New phone too, LG V30 on home Wi-Fi.  Still pushes notifications when i turn thrm off too.

 As of the last update, the standings screen does not toggle to the NFC, but only shows the AFC standings. When I submitted a notification through the feedback option, the reply was that they were "working on it" and "make sure you have the most up-to-date version".  The up to date version is the one with the problem!   FIX THE BLOODY PROBLEM instead of giving us stupid, meaningless platitudes.

 I primarily watch on my phone. If I get pulled out of the app for ANY reason, it starts the game over and if I have no idea where I was in the game by the minute it s a pain trying to find my place. Seems like an easy thing to fix, 1 star until it s fixed, NFL has tons of money I expect a little quality control in the app. Right now quality sucks

 I like the app, when it works. But I frequently have issues streaming live games, and the app will continually try to authenticate my provider even though I use Verizon. Also, the live feed is behind by several minutes. So, the app will often spoil the fact that a scoring play occurred before I even get into the live stream. It would also be nice to have the ability to cast to a larger screen.

 It s good for scores if you re not watching the game, because you ll be 3-6 minutes behind the TV broadcast.  IT S NOT THE USERS, and their suggestions on how to fix this weren t helpful.  I was streaming from a brand new Note8 with a fresh install.  Verizon says it doesn t count against your data cap anymore, but for a supposed live service, a 5 minute delay isn t worth free data.  Maybe one of these days those acclaimed Verizon engineers that worked with Google on the Pixel can figure out why they can t stream live NFL games.  Amazon has it figured out, but they only do Thursday night games.

 Wish i could give it a ZERO.  Another crappy season of NFL mobile on Verizon. 5 years in a row.  Doesn t get better.  A 3-hour football game with 1 hour of buffering, 30 minutes of dead air and 30 minutes of commercials.  Amazingly the app never buffers during the commercials only during the game play.  Imagine that!

 I think the NFL is a shameful reminder of what too much $$$ and privilege just because you can throw or catch a ball, does to you.  If you don t love this country that has given you these opportunities, you can walk through the border into any other country you eant but you are not welcome here.

 This app is always buggy. The rosters for each team are old and outdated. Can t access the player cards anymore like you could years ago. The screens lock up when scrolling a bunch. No matter what I do I can t stop the damn notifications of the game starts and final scores. I hate that so much because I may have to DVR the game and I don t want it ruined for me by this dumb app! I expect much better for something associated with the NFL. This app has been bad ever since it went to this latest design and was presented by verizon. Been waiting for it to get better but it hasn t at all. Get a new main sponsor and hire a new designer to redo this app for 2018. Not a good job! Not at all!

 Used to like this app, now it just bothers me with alerts despite manually turning them off. They still go off on my phone at least 4 times a week. I want to use this app as I prefer and when I choose, not be nagged by it randomly when it had been set not to at all in the first place.

 Pack a punch!  Okay so if I DISTORT my everyday phone call quality by touching on u0026amp; off switches in BlueTooth, u0026amp; I watch a video inside your app, will I be subject to the same dipthong mixup (without headphones, video game controller or PAC-MAN AV cable inserted)?  Bit territorial, mind me.   Chained to the wheel of a burning wagon, a teamster faces a grisly end.

 Notifications and team articles are great, but the live stream is horrendous. It averages three to four minutes behind the notifications, so it spoils everything that is showing. And anything below five bars of 4g gets constant buffering even when the stream drops down to 144p,  causing the stream to drop even further behind the notifications. For reference, I can stream Netflix or YouTube at 1080p with no interruptions under the same network conditions.

 This would be a great app if it actually worked. Not only are you not able to watch streams that say watch now but if you hit NFC vs AFC AFC still displays. There are so many small glitches and bad design choices that this app is honestly just terrible to use. It just happens to be the only NFL app so you deal with it

 I have 2 major problems with this app.  1. The games are "Live" but are always between 3 and 5 minutes delayed from what s on TV.  If i watch the drive chart I get a more accurate understanding of the current plays.  2. The drive chart is always messed up, especially on Sunday night football telecasts. The game is at halftime but the drive chart shows a play from 3 minutes before halftime as the most recent play.  Get you stuff together NFL Network.  This is a very poor way to treat your fans.

 Still one star! Yay!.The most annoying app I have that I have to use. Rest assured, you won t miss any commercials. They play in their entirety, often twice. Commercials ALWAYS play, and then at some point it skips some of the game.It s like the game buffer doesn t work as good as the commercial buffer. The problem is getting worse. You can temporarily fix it by uninstalling and reinstalling, but you re sure to miss a touchdown or two doing it. Commercials that only NFL mobile users see play over and over and over and over. Then, some of the game is skipped. Happening  every game, very frequent, annoying commercial breaks. How about more game, less commercial. At least show the game.

 It seems the feed cuts out consrantly, but the commercials play with no interruptions.  It would be nice if there were a better mix of ads - 2 to 3 commercials over and over during a 3 hour broadcast is agitating.  I do appreciate being able to watch on the go and am glad the NFL offers the mobile app.

 Love to keep up on the schedule of my favorite team.  I can see what time they play next, against whom and on what station.  Lots of other great info from throughout the season as well.

 I paid for a game day pass but after a few months it stopped being reflected on the app. I contacted Verizon and NFL but no one can help me on this.  Basically I lost $74.99 in the middle of the season.
